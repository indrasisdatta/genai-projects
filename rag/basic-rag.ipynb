      "It's about Tim Ciphert now and it is about two to win from three deliveries. So another wicket now. Makes you sit forward, doesn't it? Field is in close. I've got to stop the single. I've got to hunt here. Get in close. Cipher to win the match. Misses. Oh no. Misses. Oh no. It's two from two. Well, the commentator in the middle here. He's He's not a betting coach anymore, Mac. Absolutely. Liberty hasn't got bad on ball there. Wow. It's good from Shami, though. He's not trying to hit the hole, which is far easier for Ciphford to get bat on ball. He's trying to create a dot. Trying to create a wicket taking opportunity. Good battle. Two off two. Tied match. Super overhead. Tied match. Super over. A few too many in 2019. Two off two. Ciphered again on strike. He's missed again. Taylor runs. Oh, the scores are tied. Ross Taylor very, very clever here. I said earlier, you can run a by to Rahul and he's done it. He's picked up on it. Ross Taylor. Wonderful thinking under pressure. That is crucial. Absolutely crucial from Taylor using all of experience. Look at him. He's off. He's running. And it meant that Ra had to hit the stumps. Taylor was through and all of a sudden it's one off one. Well, Ciphert's got to be aware of the same thing here. New Zealand can't lose this match. But Shami's best ball has been that one. That's been his best ball. Rahul, for his part, has got to come a lot closer. He's got to make sure the ball gets to him real quick. He could take a glove off perhaps so he's got something to throw with. He's too deep for me. Rahul, they can run a by to him. Ciphford is lightning quick. So even if Taylor misses, New Zealander odds on to win this. He has taken a a glove off. Interesting. So he can catch it and throw in the same motion. He's still too far back for mine. He's bringing everyone up. Ver Coley, he's only got one on the boundary at fine leg. Everyone is out. One to win. Keep the series alive. New Zealand. Taylor drinks it on. No, no, no. For the upbeat time, we're going to a super over. Look at Coley. Look at the emotion. Look at Shami. What a last over, folks. That is pressure. Wow. What a game of cricket that is. And it's not over. I'm done with super overs, but let's have another one. Smith, that's your first one. It's your first one talking about them. It's easy up on the balcony watching them. I get paid enough to do that this many super overs in one year. You're the super over king. Oh yeah, sure. Of course, India stay out there, don't they? Tell us the rules. Come on, you know the rules. India stay out there. New Zealand have to come first. Yes. So, New Zealand will designate three batsmen. So, they'll be talking about it now. They'll be thinking who's going to bowl from an Indian point of view. Well, could be Jadesia, could be Brumra, maybe Shami. As we see the wicket has been operating back of length. This time he's thrown it up. Taylor normally so good at hitting that through the offside. He's tried to drag it inside edge. Now, look at that emotion. What a game. Oh, look at the emotion. I I just love watching Coley. I mean, I could watch Coley all night with the bat, but I just love his his attitude in the field. It's just so infectious. Ross Taylor just had to find a gap. Just had to make better contact than that. Now then Kane Williamson is already out there. He's already out the front. He's made up his mind that he's going to go back out there. Kane Williamson. So who's going to go with him? Batting coach, former uh Gupt. Surely Guptal has to go and it's probably Taylor maybe at three because he's just been out there. Ah, probably your three. Williamson is the easy one. Sick of super overs. There's the beast from the east. Ravi Shastri in the background. The coach of all India with a few words to say. I'm sure he's going to go out there. Is he Ravi? Let's uh just review why we've got to this ridiculous situation again. 179 for six. up till 31. Williamson a brilliant and I mean brilliant 95 and Ross Taylor knocked over last ball needing just a single for glory. Eight extras, six buys, two legs leg buys and a real vintage situation of sides handling pressure not handling pressure and then in the end handling pressure from India's point of view. New Zealand New Zealand were favorites going into the last two overs. I think it's fair to say and India have got out of this and given themselves a lifeline. Remember, if they get out and win, they've won the series. That's what's at stake here. Takur two for 21. Impressive tonight. Shami when it mattered came through with the goods. Two crucial wickets in that over. Williamson and then of course Taylor. The two New Zealand's best players. Look at Ravi Shast Street. Stern look on his face. He and Kohley masterminding this Indian performance. Well, they probably given it away with two or three overs to go. But that's the thing about this Indian side. They never give up. They keep coming at you. Okay. Who do you bowl on this on the spinner friendly pitch? Do you go jadeia? Do you go BRA? Personally, I'd go Jadeia. I love obviously Bulmer has done it many many times. He's done it for India in World Cups. He's done it for Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Looks like we're focusing on him and he's probably the favorite. Leg Asia on this surface just hard to hit from ball one. This is crazy stuff. Who's going to bowl from New Zealand's point of view? Oh, that's so far in the future. I think Do they have to decide that at the same time, Smithy? New Zealand are the super over. The super over suckers, aren't they? They're just It just continues. It's Boomerra. You can tell by those conversations they're going to their number one man. And you can understand that. I guess I can tell you right here and now I've seen Martin Guptal. He's primed. Williamson and Guptal. It will be to begin with. New Zealand can nominate three batsmen. There are two of them. Somewhere underneath there will be Taylor or Deg Grondolm or someone. Won't be grown home. I don't think so. You don't think so? No, I think Taylor's probably Look, to be honest, Williamson obviously, but Gupt New Zealand's two best batters tonight. So, no surprises there. They've dealt with the surface pretty well, but they're going to be up against Jasm Bruna, who hasn't had the greatest night. I don't think India can believe their luck that they're still out there and with a chance to be fair. It's a four off two New Zealand needed after Taylor six before Williams's dismissal. It would have started to relax, I think, a little bit in the changing room. We've done all the hard work. Four off two. Those two dot balls deciphered were critical. Chami, what a great job he did in that final over. Oh, that was pinpoint bowling. It really was that had all the drama. I mean, we'll relive it time after time, but the running of the buy was crucial to get New Zealand and their infor player on strike. Shami came up with the goods. Can I just tell you if this super over ends in a No, stop it, Mr. Smith. Stop it. I've retired, but you stay cuz there's another super over. There you go. There we go. Jasper Bumra and it will be Kane Williamson on strike. This is New Zealand's third super over this year. Well, not this calendar year 2020, mate. Yeah, third and 12 months. Third and less than that. Third and five months. Oh, we're due for a different result from the other two. Let's just say that. Absolutely correct. VDS is down on the boundary. Never hit the plan a super overall bet. Words of advice for Vat Kohi maybe. Coley will direct proceedings from deep mid off which is always interesting for me the skipper down there. Interesting that Boomer's come to a different end from where he bowled during the 20 over match. He's come down to the commentary end obviously maybe thought it didn't go so well at the other end here. So I'll try the other end and see what happens. 3 m longer down here. 59 down towards the far end. Only 662 this way. You're right. He's thought about that. Maybe they've got to hit slightly into the wind. The Westerly coming in. It's 25 to 12 local time. There's an outside chance this game could start today and finish tomorrow. And it's only a 20 over game for goodness sake. Right, let's get on with it. What do we got? We've got three inside the circle on the offside and one on the on side. Men all over the park on the onside, but Williamson's hitting it all around the clock. Can he find that touch again after a short break? Here's Bumra. 4-1. Yeah, they got to keep running. They got to keep running. But remember, they can't lose wicket early in the over. They cannot do that. No, they can't. That's the risk you take. Got to get better on ball. That's the first thing you know that Boomer is going to bowl. Mixture between that Yorker and the slower ball. Gabbdul hasn't been in for a while. So important that get some bat on ball. It's important to get a boundary. Earn the first three balls and put some pressure on the bowl. Totally agree. I totally agree. They must find an early boundary here. And for Martin Guts, this is not easy. He's been uh sitting watching for the thick end of an hour and a half to find instant momentum. It's not easy at all. And for that reason, the timing isn't there. Just two of two. New Zealand boundary hunting desperately now. Well, it was there to go, wasn't it? Bumra missed. It was a full toss, but Gupta has been sitting in the shed for a while. There's no timing at all, which is probably a good thing. It meant that it didn't carry to Ver Kohley down at long off. Wonder if Williamson can just give himself a bit of room and try and get it down to third man. He's He's got all the options. He's got all his shots. But which is the right one for this? The third ball from Bumra. It's that one. It's that one. And it's a good one. Williamson. He now has scored over 100 runs in this match. Oh, it's a wonderful shot. High pressure situation. Once again, he's reverted back to what he's so good at, creating the angle, stepping a foot outside off stump. Bulmer didn't miss, but he missed his length. Given Williamson a chance to use the angle, hasn't got all of it. There's plenty of pace on Bulmer's offered. He got length and pace, and he used it beautifully, didn't he? By going across his stumps and getting that angle. Saw him play that shot earlier in the night as well. This is a really interesting ball for me now. He does he do the same thing or does he change it up? Surely he'll take some pace off. Slam wide. Oh, that's over the top. Coley won't run that down either. Four and a six. So now that is 12 with two deliveries left. He reverted to pace again. This time he's tried to follow Williamson. Think he might go outside off stump. This time Williamson's gone the other way. Access it over. All he had to do is beat Barack Collie at long off. It's a wonderful shot. Those boundaries you're after. There's still room for class and technique, isn't there, in this situation. Bon under pressure now. Two balls to go. Oh, they got to run a by. They will run a by. And a collision. Williamson's job's done with the bat. He's got night's far from over though. So 13. What was that in that World Cup match? Is it 16 New Zealand needed? Oh, pinch me. Pinch me. It's a free hit this [Music] one. Captain on strike. Last ball. Can he find a gap? Yes, he can. Big finish. That's really, really good from these two. 17. So India needs 17 to force us to another super over or 18 to end the evening. Well, really tough to know what a pass score is. That's an excellent effort from Williamson. He got the ball rolling with that six over fine leg. Gap's finisher. It's a full toss. It's likely over toss from Bumra. Dragged it wide along on 17. Good score. Great score. Three boundaries in the over. The over started well by Boom with two singles, but then Gabul Williamson did the job. That is a very good total. Very good total for the New Zealand batsman. Now the big question is who's going to bowl that super over for New Zealand? Probably two candidates. Probably Saudi and Satner. Which way will they go? Si Tim Sa's got that look on his face. Tim Sa giving the ball. This is the over. No timing. New Zealand at this stage of panicking. Just two singles from two and then a little master. Enough of that. He said one over the onside, one over the offside. Two different lengths to deal with. Guptal runs the buy. Nearly a collision. And then Gul gets that low toss and finds the spot with some good timing there. So again they've taken India's best the 16 at a crucial stage. It will be Tim Saudi. It looks like Tim Saudi. I'm not sure anyone else is volunteering. I like it. He's New Zealand's most experienced bowler. I'm sure he's put his hand up and said, \"Give me the ball. I'll do the job.\" And I guess that's all you can ask. certainly got the experience and the ability to do the job he's got. 18 runs, well 17 really that he has to protect. A little bit nervous. A nervous smile on the face, but he's done it before. Third time lucky. You got to bring some of the old phrases out, don't you? Third time lucky. Third super over. Come on. Got to lose a couple to win one. Oh, you just chuck away the World Cup final. So, so you know how to win one back in Hamilton. Yeah. Good one, Matt. Oh, drama. Oh, I love it. I absolutely love it. Lost years of my life, but I love it. Fantastic. They'll be calling you Mr. Super over soon, so that would be your nickname. Nearly Mr. Superanuation. Well, you need Nessa Hussein beside you. Yeah. Well, that's the upside, I suppose. Hope you're listening, N. Very good morning to you. Right. Who do India go with from a batting point of view? Coley's got to be one. Sharma's probably got to be the other. Oh, the top three. You just go the top three, don't you? K Ru as well. The only other player probably Well, you could go. You're asking a lot of uh Shuis or even Jadesia as a right hand left-hander, but I I think you'll find it the big three. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, hard to go past them. Is he used to having hit from ball one? [Music] What order do you think they go in here? Do you stick with your openers in Coley at three or does he come up to the top? I think it's seen the magician out and he will he'll accept the responsibility I believe like Williamson did. I think you'll see Kohen Sharma. Yep. I'm happy with [Music] that. Maybe it's Rahul then. Maybe we're hearing it may well be Rahul. He's had a busy night. Batting, keeping, batting. Be fair. All three are in pretty good touch. They have been throughout this series. They've all taken their turns. Bill placing is another key here. So Williamson's night is far from done in that respect. He has to work out where Sally wants to bowl and how to protect it the best that he can. Won't be able to protect. It's a very, as you say, a very hard ground to restrict on. Ball just flies on this ground here at Seden Park. It just bound boundaries obviously aren't the biggest, but because those boundaries aren't the biggest means that the fielders have to be very precise with where they're at. balls 5 m either side of you. You just can't stop it. Can't cut it off. It looks like to me they're going with the top two who have seen pretty good form throughout the series. Sharma tonight was exceptional. 65 from 40 and it really was an impressive innings and K rail well he's scored plenty of runs. Kane Williamson's got to get the troops around in the circle here. I wonder what he's saying. Wonder what he's saying. Now fellas, we know about these. We know how to do this. We just got to do it a bit better. Now this is what we're going to have. We can see Mitchell's on the field. Mitchell, it looks like he is on the park. So we'll identify who's off very shortly. You know he's [Applause] [Music] sod Monroe of course Colum Monroe took the blow while batting so he's off the park. So Mitchell is on. How's he going to get a dot or or one? I mean, a one's a win here. Obviously, even a two's a win. Is he going to operate with his with his yorkers or is he going to buy those little leg cutters to the righthanders? You got to basically shut off one area of the ground, do you? You can't hold too straight. You can't give them hitting options on both sides. You got to deny boundaries. That's the key. New Zealand hit three over fine leg up. So, that suggests falling straight, doesn't it? Yeah, all knuckle balls. All wide knuckle balls, which he's bowled quite a few of. And I guess that means why he's got a deep extra cover long off. There's no point having a sweeper square. He can't afford to bowl short. Don't go too wide of stump. Yes, he's got protection. Three there. Only if he's got no pace, right? Three inside the circle behind point on the off side. I want to see the Tim S yorker. Here we go. 17 to tie, 18 to win. First one, no timing. It was there to hit two. Can't afford a run out. Can't afford a run out. Can't two off one. An opportunity there for New Zealand to put so much early pressure on. Wrong end. K Rail wasn't coming. Sharma was always coming for two. And you watch KL Rail, he puts the hand up and says no, he wasn't going. had to be to the bowler. It's where you need that communication. Ciphford still had the chance to take the bales off and missed. Well, he took his glove off thinking he was going to throw to the bowlers's end, but what he didn't realize it was on at his end. Anyway, two off one. Still need 15 for a tie. Not going to get them that way. Only one from there. It's up to Rahul. He has to hit big now. New Zealand, we've said it before, are in the box seat. Don't say it, Smoothie, please. Okay, ignore the fact that I just said New Zealand are in the box seat. Good start to the over though, but they are. I think what we've seen from Sharma in the first two balls here is that he's trying to over hit the ball. He's looking for that boundary. He's lost his timing. saw in his innings earlier tonight just the ability just to play good cricket shots and time the ball that's the pressure of the situation I guess I think it is but I think Sally knows if he misses his yorker six straight back over his head so there's plenty of pressure on him that second yorker executed perfectly right though keep your shape from a batting point of view trust your power po on the leg side and Williamson has gone down a fine leg. All boundary riders just protecting the rope. That's all they need to do. Singles and twos are fine at this point. Found a gap. kicked in there into gear and now they need just 10 off three to tie. Smart batting from Ro. He knew where it was going to be delivered because of the field so he steps across. Seen a lot of success with that method tonight and he found the gap. Good timing. Four out on the leg side. It's a little bit predictable where Tim's going to go. He's kept it the same. Just got to find a slightly better length, doesn't he? Or he has confidence. Has a dip at leg pole. Knows KL Ro is going to have a step across outside off stump. Oh, he can't get timing. This is good. Sharma's going to have to be on Sharma. It was a fumble from Sandler. They could have got two perhaps. Pressure all around the joint. Nine from two. Got to get a boundary here. Simple as that. has to go for four or six. Beautiful from Sally the angled straight into leg stump. Har roll give himself a bit of room. We can hit it either over long off or use the angle this time. He's shuffled forward, he shuffled back almost leg side of leg stump. Followed him. Nice from Saudi because Kra couldn't get underneath it to get any leverage because of that angle and that length. Right. This is the ball. This is the ball. If this goes to the rope, it's all on for young and old. They got to stop us going to the rope. New Zealand. Oh my. That's big. That's massive. It's out of the ground. Oh [Applause] no. We're down to three to tie. Three to tie. Rod Sharma got the half volley and dealt to it. Oh, he smoked it. It was in the slot. See how they missed his length. Sham is too good a player to miss out on that. Got some height on it just for a second. Guptal eyed it up. And wow, this game continues to give. Well, threes without overthrows on this ground a lot. Hence teeth. I think the last time they ran a three here in this situation, Hal's Comet threw flew over. So that won't happen. I'm not sure we're looking at a tie. I think we're looking at a win or a loss unless there's an overthrow. Guess what delivery? What are these two talking about? What delivery is he going to go to under the pump? Well, I think he's got to back himself to to bowler. He's got a leg stump Yorker. I mean, if if he misses, he's going out of the park. So be it. But it's your best ball. I don't think these guys are going to mist time anything through the offside. I got four leg buys in my head. Get it out of there quickly. Down to those fine boundaries here. That's that's what you expose now. If you've got width either side, you're exposing third man. Fine leg is quite wide. Right. Here we go. Here we go. New Zealand. Can they get it this time? The third time of asking. Si three to tie, four to win. Sharma on strike. He hits back. He hits two back. Who's done it? Sha has done it and they are delirious. Unbelievable seeds of joy again in New Zealand have to go down on their knees and suffer once more. 20 of Tim Salvi. Look at the scenes of joy. Coley leads the charge again. Again, glory is ripped away from the men in black. This game is cruel. So cruel from a New Zealand point of view. It's in the slot. Wasn't executed. Sharma under the pump. Two sixes to kill this game in the super over. Look at those Indian fans. They can't believe it. Look at the joy. That is some performance. Some game of cricket. Your first two balls of the over. We talked about Sharma potentially trying to over hit. He certainly didn't over hit that. He didn't over hit the ball before. Tim Saudi has gone to what he's so good at trying to hit the Yorker. He's missed twice. Ro Sharma has taken advantage of it and they win the series. Well, they win the match and they win the series. They lead the series 3-0.\n",

He's done it for India in World Cups. He's done it for Mumbai Indians in the IPL. Looks like we're focusing on him and he's probably the favorite. Leg Asia on this surface just hard to hit from ball one. This is crazy stuff. Who's going to bowl from New Zealand's point of view? Oh, that's so far in the future. I think Do they have to decide that at the same\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"point of view? Oh, that's so far in the future. I think Do they have to decide that at the same time, Smithy? New Zealand are the super over. The super over suckers, aren't they? They're just It just continues. It's Boomerra. You can tell by those conversations they're going to their number one man. And you can understand that. I guess I can tell you right here and now I've seen Martin Guptal. He's primed. Williamson and Guptal. It will be to begin with. New Zealand can nominate three batsmen. There are two of them. Somewhere underneath there will be Taylor or Deg Grondolm or someone. Won't be grown home. I don't think so. You don't think so? No, I think Taylor's probably Look, to be honest, Williamson obviously, but Gupt New Zealand's two best batters tonight. So, no surprises there. They've dealt with the surface pretty well, but they're going to be up against Jasm Bruna, who hasn't had the greatest night. I don't think India can believe their luck that they're still out there and\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"had the greatest night. I don't think India can believe their luck that they're still out there and with a chance to be fair. It's a four off two New Zealand needed after Taylor six before Williams's dismissal. It would have started to relax, I think, a little bit in the changing room. We've done all the hard work. Four off two. Those two dot balls deciphered were critical. Chami, what a great job he did in that final over. Oh, that was pinpoint bowling. It really was that had all the drama. I mean, we'll relive it time after time, but the running of the buy was crucial to get New Zealand and their infor player on strike. Shami came up with the goods. Can I just tell you if this super over ends in a No, stop it, Mr. Smith. Stop it. I've retired, but you stay cuz there's another super over. There you go. There we go. Jasper Bumra and it will be Kane Williamson on strike. This is New Zealand's third super over this year. Well, not this calendar year 2020, mate. Yeah, third and 12\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Zealand's third super over this year. Well, not this calendar year 2020, mate. Yeah, third and 12 months. Third and less than that. Third and five months. Oh, we're due for a different result from the other two. Let's just say that. Absolutely correct. VDS is down on the boundary. Never hit the plan a super overall bet. Words of advice for Vat Kohi maybe. Coley will direct proceedings from deep mid off which is always interesting for me the skipper down there. Interesting that Boomer's come to a different end from where he bowled during the 20 over match. He's come down to the commentary end obviously maybe thought it didn't go so well at the other end here. So I'll try the other end and see what happens. 3 m longer down here. 59 down towards the far end. Only 662 this way. You're right. He's thought about that. Maybe they've got to hit slightly into the wind. The Westerly coming in. It's 25 to 12 local time. There's an outside chance this game could start today and finish tomorrow.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"25 to 12 local time. There's an outside chance this game could start today and finish tomorrow. And it's only a 20 over game for goodness sake. Right, let's get on with it. What do we got? We've got three inside the circle on the offside and one on the on side. Men all over the park on the onside, but Williamson's hitting it all around the clock. Can he find that touch again after a short break? Here's Bumra. 4-1. Yeah, they got to keep running. They got to keep running. But remember, they can't lose wicket early in the over. They cannot do that. No, they can't. That's the risk you take. Got to get better on ball. That's the first thing you know that Boomer is going to bowl. Mixture between that Yorker and the slower ball. Gabbdul hasn't been in for a while. So important that get some bat on ball. It's important to get a boundary. Earn the first three balls and put some pressure on the bowl. Totally agree. I totally agree. They must find an early boundary here. And for Martin Guts,\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"bowl. Totally agree. I totally agree. They must find an early boundary here. And for Martin Guts, this is not easy. He's been uh sitting watching for the thick end of an hour and a half to find instant momentum. It's not easy at all. And for that reason, the timing isn't there. Just two of two. New Zealand boundary hunting desperately now. Well, it was there to go, wasn't it? Bumra missed. It was a full toss, but Gupta has been sitting in the shed for a while. There's no timing at all, which is probably a good thing. It meant that it didn't carry to Ver Kohley down at long off. Wonder if Williamson can just give himself a bit of room and try and get it down to third man. He's He's got all the options. He's got all his shots. But which is the right one for this? The third ball from Bumra. It's that one. It's that one. And it's a good one. Williamson. He now has scored over 100 runs in this match. Oh, it's a wonderful shot. High pressure situation. Once again, he's reverted back to what\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"match. Oh, it's a wonderful shot. High pressure situation. Once again, he's reverted back to what he's so good at, creating the angle, stepping a foot outside off stump. Bulmer didn't miss, but he missed his length. Given Williamson a chance to use the angle, hasn't got all of it. There's plenty of pace on Bulmer's offered. He got length and pace, and he used it beautifully, didn't he? By going across his stumps and getting that angle. Saw him play that shot earlier in the night as well. This is a really interesting ball for me now. He does he do the same thing or does he change it up? Surely he'll take some pace off. Slam wide. Oh, that's over the top. Coley won't run that down either. Four and a six. So now that is 12 with two deliveries left. He reverted to pace again. This time he's tried to follow Williamson. Think he might go outside off stump. This time Williamson's gone the other way. Access it over. All he had to do is beat Barack Collie at long off. It's a wonderful shot.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"way. Access it over. All he had to do is beat Barack Collie at long off. It's a wonderful shot. Those boundaries you're after. There's still room for class and technique, isn't there, in this situation.

What was that in that World Cup match? Is it 16 New Zealand needed? Oh, pinch me. Pinch me. It's a free hit this [Music] one. Captain on strike. Last ball. Can he find a gap? Yes, he can. Big finish. That's really, really good from these two. 17. So India needs 17 to force us to another super over or 18 to end the evening. Well, really tough to know what a pass score is. That's an excellent effort from Williamson. He got the ball rolling with that six over fine leg. Gap's finisher. It's a full toss. It's likely over toss from Bumra. Dragged it wide along on 17. Good score. Great score. Three\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"toss. It's likely over toss from Bumra. Dragged it wide along on 17. Good score. Great score. Three boundaries in the over. The over started well by Boom with two singles, but then Gabul Williamson did the job. That is a very good total. Very good total for the New Zealand batsman. Now the big question is who's going to bowl that super over for New Zealand? Probably two candidates. Probably Saudi and Satner. Which way will they go? Si Tim Sa's got that look on his face. Tim Sa giving the ball. This is the over. No timing. New Zealand at this stage of panicking. Just two singles from two and then a little master. Enough of that. He said one over the onside, one over the offside. Two different lengths to deal with. Guptal runs the buy. Nearly a collision. And then Gul gets that low toss and finds the spot with some good timing there. So again they've taken India's best the 16 at a crucial stage. It will be Tim Saudi. It looks like Tim Saudi.

Got to lose a couple to win one. Oh, you just chuck away the World Cup final. So, so you know how to win one back in Hamilton. Yeah. Good one, Matt. Oh, drama. Oh, I love it. I absolutely love it. Lost years of my life, but I love it. Fantastic. They\\'ll be calling you Mr. Super over soon, so that would be your nickname. Nearly Mr. Superanuation. Well, you need Nessa Hussein beside you. Yeah.

Hope you're listening, N. Very good morning to you. Right. Who do India go with from a batting point of view? Coley's got to be one. Sharma's probably got to be the other. Oh, the top three. You just go the top three, don't you? K Ru as well. The only other player probably Well, you could go. You're asking a lot of uh Shuis or even Jadesia as a right hand left-hander, but I I think you'll find it the big three. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, hard to go past them. Is he used to having hit from ball one? [Music] What order do you think they go in here? Do you stick with your openers in Coley at three or does he come up to the top? I think it's seen the magician out and he will he'll accept the responsibility I believe like Williamson did. I think you'll see Kohen Sharma. Yep. I'm happy with [Music] that. Maybe it's Rahul then.

He's had a busy night. Batting, keeping, batting. Be fair. All three are in pretty good touch. They have been throughout this series. They've all taken their turns. Bill placing is another key here. So Williamson's night is far from done in that respect. He has to work out where Sally wants to bowl and how to protect it the best that he can. Won't be able to protect. It's a very, as you say, a very hard ground to restrict on. Ball just flies on this ground here at Seden Park. It just bound boundaries obviously aren't the biggest, but because those boundaries aren't the biggest means that the fielders have to be very precise with where they're at. balls 5 m either side of you. You just can't stop it. Can't cut it off. It looks like to me they're going with the top two who have seen pretty good form throughout the series.

We can see Mitchell's on the field. Mitchell, it looks like he is on the park. So we'll identify who's off very shortly. You know he's [Applause] [Music] sod Monroe of course Colum Monroe took the blow while batting so he's off the park. So Mitchell is on. How's he going to get a dot or or one? I mean, a one's a win here. Obviously, even a two's a win. Is he going to operate with his with his yorkers or is he going to buy those little leg cutters to the righthanders?

You can't hold too straight. You can't give them hitting options on both sides. You got to deny boundaries. That's the key. New Zealand hit three over fine leg up. So, that suggests falling straight, doesn't it? Yeah, all knuckle balls. All wide knuckle balls, which he's bowled quite a few of. And I guess that means why he's got a deep extra cover long off. There's no point having a sweeper square. He can't afford to bowl short. Don't go too wide of stump. Yes, he's got protection. Three there. Only if he's got no pace, right? Three inside the circle behind point on the off side. I want to see the Tim S yorker. Here we go. 17 to tie, 18 to win. First one, no timing. It was there to hit two. Can't afford a run out.

Anyway, two off one. Still need 15 for a tie. Not going to get them that way. Only one from there. It's up to Rahul. He has to hit big now. New Zealand, we've said it before, are in the box seat. Don't say it, Smoothie, please. Okay, ignore the fact that I just said New Zealand are in the box seat. Good start to the over though, but they are. I think what we've seen from Sharma in the first two balls here is that he's trying to over hit the ball. He's looking for that boundary. He's lost his timing. saw in his innings earlier tonight just the ability just to play good cricket shots and time the ball that's the pressure of the\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"just the ability just to play good cricket shots and time the ball that's the pressure of the situation I guess I think it is but I think Sally knows if he misses his yorker six straight back over his head so there's plenty of pressure on him that second yorker executed perfectly right though keep your shape from a batting point of view trust your power po on the leg side and Williamson has gone down a fine leg. All boundary riders just protecting the rope. That's all they need to do. Singles and twos are fine at this point. Found a gap. kicked in there into gear and now they need just 10 off three to tie.

Beautiful from Sally the angled straight into leg stump. Har roll give himself a bit of room. We can hit it either over long off or use the angle this time.

Right. This is the ball. This is the ball. If this goes to the rope, it's all on for young and old. They got to stop us going to the rope. New Zealand. Oh my. That's big. That's massive.

We're down to three to tie. Three to tie. Rod Sharma got the half volley and dealt to it. Oh, he smoked it. It was in the slot. See how they missed his length. Sham is too good a player to miss out on that. Got some height on it just for a second. Guptal eyed it up. And wow, this game continues to give. Well, threes without overthrows on this ground a lot. Hence teeth. I think the last time they ran a three here in this situation, Hal's Comet threw flew over. So that won't happen. I'm not sure we're looking at a tie. I think we're looking at a win or a loss unless there's an overthrow. Guess what delivery? What are these two talking about? What delivery is he going to go to under the pump?
